## Understanding Evening Pregnancy Nausea

Evening nausea, often called "night sickness," can be particularly challenging as fatigue sets in and certain food smells become more intense. According to [The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/morning-sickness-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy), while commonly known as "morning sickness," pregnancy nausea can strike at any time of day.
